* # Additional comments
  - pretty straight forward project. knowing what I know now, a lot of this was fresh in my mind, so not many difficulties were encountered. 

  - I did have a hurdle where I suppose my repo became unsynced and I couldnt use any git command without getting a fatal error: unable to read tree. it seemed to be not a well documented issue so the only option was to reclone and manually put back the changed which was annoying, but oh well
