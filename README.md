  Given a non-stop desire to create my own eBay clone, I developed a back-end server using Express to build a RESTful API that can handle an online store's database. Within this Node application, I used the Sequelize package to communicate with my DB, and Insomnia to test all get, put, post, and delete routes.

(Jul/14/21)

  - pretty straight forward project. knowing what I know now, a lot of this was fresh in my mind, so not many difficulties were encountered. 

  - I did have a hurdle where I suppose my repo became unsynced and I couldnt use any git command without getting a fatal error: unable to read tree. it seemed to not be a well documented issue so the only option was to reclone and manually put back the changed which was annoying, oh well.
